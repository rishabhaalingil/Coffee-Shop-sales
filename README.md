# Objective
The objective of this project is to construct a dynamic PowerBI dashboard that will assess the sales performance of the coffee shop's products and categories, as well as identify the most popular items among customers.The dashboard also helps to analyze sales trends over time,including peak sales period and seasonal variations.
# Project Highlights
1. Data walkthrough:The data contains around 1.5L records and contains the sales data of the coffee shop from the starting of the year 2023 till the month of June.It includes various information regarding the sales,product information, store information and other quantitative data.
2. Data preparation:A database was created in MySQL and a table was created for importing the data.
3. Data import:The sales data was then imported into MySQL using the load data infile statement for a faster import.
4. Data cleaning:The imported dataset was then cleaned and the data formats were corrected.
5. Data extraction:The dataset was queried for business requirements and the results were stored.
6. Data loading and quality check:Loading the data into powerbi and checking for the data quality.
7. Data modelling:Created a date table and established relationship between the transactions table and the date table.
8. Chart:Created charts for analyzing the business requirements and for deriving insights regarding the sales performance of the products and by the different store locations.
9. Filters:Applied filters and slicers for analyzing the sales performance as per the selected filters.
10. Insights Generated:Gathered insights and shared the same with the stakeholders.
11. Data validation:The results obtained from powerbi were then compared with those obtained from the SQL queries.

# Key Insights
1. Total Sales Overview: The strong rise in sales, orders and quantities shows that marketing efforts and customer engagement are effective.
2. Sales by Weekday/Weekend: Weekday sales are higher, probably as a result of commuters and office workers. The store may get more casual or family consumers on leisure days, as evidenced by the weekend sales lagging.
3. Location-Based Sales: Even though every location is performing well, targeted tactics in underperforming areas could maximize sales everywhere.
4. Product Category Sales:The most popular beverage is coffee, although tea and drinking chocolate are expanding more quickly, indicating a growing need for non-coffee alternatives. Bundling bakery items with drinks could increase revenue.
5. Best-Selling Items: Sales of espresso are at the top, followed by chai tea and hot chocolate, indicating a change in consumer preferences. Upselling chances are excellent for high-end products like herbal teas and gourmet coffee.
6. Sales by Day and Hour:Peak Sales Hours: 7 AM to 11 AM, especially on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. 
Low Sales Hours: Early mornings (6 AMâ€“7 AM) and after 5 PM. Peak hours align with typical coffee consumption patterns, but early mornings and late evenings see less activity
# Recommendations
Analyzing data from all months offers critical insights for business growth. To enhance customer traffic, boost sales and strengthen brand loyalty, here are some strategic actions:

1. Organize weekend specials and events to attract more customers on Saturdays and Sundays.
2. Introduce combo offers (e.g. drinks + bakery items) to encourage higher customer spending.
3. Showcase popular items and launch new ones to keep the menu exciting.
4. Offer promotions during slower times (such as early mornings and late afternoons) to boost traffic.
5. Sell branded merchandise (e.g. mugs, reusable cups, tote bags) to enhance brand recognition and create additional revenue streams.
6. Targeted Marketing: Boost sales during mid-month slumps and underperforming categories.
7. Operational Efficiency: Optimize staffing and inventory for peak hours and locations.
8. Strategic Planning: Leverage these insights to drive better sales performance and customer satisfaction.
